	<h2>What is a typhoon?</h2>
	<p>A typhoon is a mature tropical cyclone that develops between 180° and 100°E in the Northern Hemisphere. This region is referred to as the Northwestern Pacific Basin, 
	and is the most active tropical cyclone basin on Earth, accounting for almost one-third of the world's annual tropical cyclones. For organizational purposes, 
	the northern Pacific Ocean is divided into three regions: the eastern (North America to 140°W), central (140°W to 180°), and western (180° to 100°E). 
	The Regional Specialized Meteorological Center (RSMC) for tropical cyclone forecasts is in Japan, with other tropical cyclone warning centers for the northwest Pacific in Hawaii 
	(the Joint Typhoon Warning Center), the Philippines and Hong Kong. While the RSMC names each system, the main name list itself is coordinated among 18 countries that 
	have territories threatened by typhoons each year.
	<p> A typhoon forms when winds blow into areas of the ocean where the water is warm. These winds collect moisture and rise, while colder air moves in below. 
		This creates pressure, which causes the winds to move very quickly. The winds rotate, or spin, around a center called an eye.

                <h3>Why do we need to mitigate typhoons?</h3>
		<p>Hurricanes and typhoons can cause catastrophic damage to coastlines and several hundred miles inland. They can produce winds exceeding 155 miles per hour as well as tornadoes and microbursts. 
		Additionally, hurricanes and typhoons can create storm surges along the coast and cause extensive damage from heavy rainfall. Floods and flying debris from the excessive winds are often the deadly and 
		destructive results of these weather events. Slow moving hurricanes and typhoons traveling into mountainous regions tend to produce especially heavy rain. Excessive rain can trigger landslides or mud slides.
		Flash flooding can occur due to intense rainfall.
